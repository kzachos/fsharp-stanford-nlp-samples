The Stanford Natural Language Processing Samples, in F#
===================================================

This project contains [Stanford NLP](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/) assemblies (compiled from *.jar files using [IKVM.NET Bytecode Compiler](http://www.ikvm.net/userguide/ikvmc.html)) with samples translated to [F#](http://fsharp.org/).


### [Stanford Parser](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) (v3.2.0 - 2013-06-20) [more](http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/nlp-stanford-parser-with-f-net/)

Implementations of probabilistic natural language parsers, both highly optimized PCFG and dependency parsers, and a lexicalized PCFG parser in Java. Includes: [Online parser demo](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/), [Stanford Dependencies](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-dependencies.shtml) page, and [Parser FAQ](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/parser-faq.shtml).

A maximum-entropy (CMM) part-of-speech (POS) tagger for English, Arabic, Chinese, French, and German, in Java.

### [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml) (v3.2.0 - 2013-06-20) [more](http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/nlp-stanford-named-entity-recognizer-with-f-net/)

A Conditional Random Field sequence model, together with well-engineered features for Named Entity Recognition in English and German. [Online NER demo](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/ner/)
